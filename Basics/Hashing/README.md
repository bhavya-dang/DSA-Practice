# Hashing Theory

Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects. Some of the most common applications of hashing include:

- **Data Retrieval**: Hashing is used to retrieve data in a faster way as it is much easier to search for a specific data element in a hash table.
- **Data Encryption**: Hashing is used to encrypt data in a secure way.
- **Data Integrity**: Hashing is used to check the integrity of data by detecting changes in the data.
- **Data Indexing**: Hashing is used to index data in a database.
- **Data Comparison**: Hashing is used to compare data in a faster way.
